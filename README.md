# FDSI-Projections-for-CONUS
This is a NCAR Command Language (NCL version 6.6.2 required) script to produce an annual time series of Forest Stress Drought Index (FDSI) between 1950-2099 using monthly projections of precipitation and vapor pressure deficit from MACAv2-metdata. Only input to the script required include (i) identification of the GCM run, and (ii) the latitude and longitude boundaries of the region. MACA data is accessed by the script via OpENDAP. Output includes a time series table in .txt and plot in .png.
