# FDSI-Projections-for-CONUS
This repository provides an NCAR Command Language (NCL version 6.6.2 required) script titled "calc_fdsi_opendap_lat-lon.txt" to produce an annual time series of the Forest Stress Drought Index (FDSI based on Williams et al., 2013) for any region in the Contiguous United States between 1950-2099 using monthly projections of precipitation and vapor pressure deficit from MACAv2-metdata. Only inputs to the script required include: (i) identification of the GCM (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/GCMs.php) and the emissions scenario (RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5), and (ii) the latitude and longitude boundaries of the region. The standardization (z-score calculations) is done relative to the climatology of the 1950-2005 time period. MACA data is accessed by the script via OpENDAP. Output includes a time series table in .txt and plot in .png. Example output files are included here: FDSI_timeseries_Rocky Mountain National Park_1951-2099_BNU-ESM_r1i1p1_rcp45_MACAv2-metdata(.png & .txt).
